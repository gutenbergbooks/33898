<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Directly</span> below the old fort of
San Cristobal, in San Juan,
Porto Rico, projecting out over
the sea from a corner of the sea
wall, is a sentry box. Years
ago a sentry, placed on duty at this lonely
post, utterly disappeared, leaving behind
only his musket and side-arms. His disappearance
was so mysterious that it was
attributed to sea-devils, and the sentry box
has ever since been given a wide berth by all
superstitious natives.</p>

<p>The same night of this strange incident, a
priest, the best liked and most admired of his
sect in the city, disappeared. The only clue
discovered in regard to his disappearance
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>was the small gold cross, which constantly
hung suspended from a chain around his
neck, found before the door of the corner
sentry box.</p>

<p>I heard many stories in regard to the
disappearance of these two, but all were too
preposterous to allow any thought of truth.
At last, however, good luck brought me into
the presence of a man who knew, and it is the
story as I heard it from him which I am
undertaking to recount.</p>

<p class="center thought-break">. . . . . . .</p>

<p>The proprietor of one of the &ldquo;tiendas&rdquo;
in Mayaguez, Juan Cordo by name, was a
large, jovial old man full of stories of wild
adventure, with which every Saturday night
he entertained a gathering composed chiefly
of the working men, who, their work over for
the week, were ready to listen to any tale
which would entertain them&mdash;and the old
storekeeper was a good talker. It was at one
of these gatherings, to which I was frequently
drawn by a desire to hear the old man's
ramblings, that I heard the story of the
haunted sentry box.</p>

<p>As usual, the old fellow, who loved to be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>urged, could for sometime think of nothing
to tell about, but he finally decided on his
subject and settling back in his chair, began.
I noticed, however, that he carefully scrutinized
the faces of his audience, that is, of
all except one. But this one was really of
little importance as he was a late arrival in
town and scarcely known to any one. As I
have said, his face was free from the scrutinizing
eye of old Juan Cordo, for, coming in
late, he had quietly seated himself behind the
story-teller without attracting his attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My story begins back in the early
seventies,&rdquo; began the old man in a thoughtful
and his usual hesitating tone. &ldquo;The capital
was the scene of crimes, of immorality and of
all sorts of disorders. There were good men,
of course, but even these were often corrupted.
An instance of this was young Pedro
Delvarez, a soldier, who had enlisted in the
army when he was but seventeen. He had
had chances which most of his associates
had not&mdash;fine parents, an education, money;
but he proved unworthy of them all. He
turned to gambling and fast living, finally
marrying a young girl, far below him in social
rank, who married him merely for his money.
His love for this girl, however, partly cured
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>him of his wild life and helped him to be a
better fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although he might have had an officer's
rank through his father's influence, he had
enlisted as a mere common soldier due to
some fool book-notion of working his way up.
But his habits retarded his progress and at
the end of six years of service he found
himself still in the ranks. He made many
enemies among his rough associates and
chief among them was a great, strong,
dastardly fellow named Torcas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a stir behind the old storekeeper
as the stranger leaned forward with a gleam
of interest in his eyes, but I thought with a
twitching of anger around his mouth. The
old man apparently did not hear him for he
continued without looking around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How this enmity began I do not know,
but it increased daily and finally reached the
boiling point when Torcas ran off with the
flighty young wife of his enemy. Young
Delvarez was heart-broken and attempted
suicide, but was luckily saved from such an
untimely death through the intervention of
good Padre Suarez. This priest had for
some reason or other taken a great liking to
the young soldier and had endeavoured in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>every way to help him. It was due to the
efforts of his clerical friend that Delvarez was
led back into the straight road and it was the
kindly advice of this same person which kept
him from a search for, and probably the
murder of, his enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life became a mere dream to the young
fellow, who went to his soldier's duties,
morose, bitter against the world, and shunning
his companions who he thought detested
him. He continued in this way for several
months till one night a crisis was reached.
He had been stationed on duty at the old
sentry box with the accusation of &lsquo;murder&rsquo;
ringing in his ears. A few minutes before, in
a quarrel, his antagonist had accused him of
it; the murder of the young, fickle wife, who,
the preceding morning, had been found dead
in her bed. He was innocent, but he had no
friends to take his side in case the law was
against him, and he had no proofs of innocence.
While he stood looking out over the
sea, contemplating his troubles, he felt a
hand placed on his shoulder and turning
quickly could just discern in the darkness the
face of the kindly padre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a wild night and the noise of the
sea and wind made hearing difficult, so that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>he could scarcely understand the priest as he
leaned forward and shouted in his ear: &lsquo;I
feel sure you're innocent&rsquo; said the priest, &lsquo;but
the others don't seem to think so. So slip
over the wall here and get away; it's your
only chance because they're coming for you
soon. Go to some other place, live a clean,
decent life, but remember, if you ever come
up against that fellow Torcas don't do anything,
for God will take vengeance on him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again there was a stir behind the story-teller
as the stranger leaned forward with the
interest in his eyes gleaming brighter than
before, while the twitching of anger around
his mouth seemed to have changed to a slight
smile. Again the old man, unconscious of
the interest he was arousing, continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good fellow had just finished
speaking when a pistol shot rang out and a
bullet burned a furrow across Delvarez's
breast to bury itself in his friend's. Delvarez
sank to the ground, but the rain
quickly revived him and he got up, the wound
on his breast, which was to trouble him
through life, burning and throbbing. At
first he thought he was again alone, but his
foot encountered something, and stooping
over he found the body of the dead priest.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>Suddenly he recalled his friend's advice and
determined to flee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feverishly he undressed himself and
exchanged clothing with the dead man. Next
he laid his firearms on the little bench which
ran around the sentry box, threw the body
over the wall, and lowered himself down
carefully after it. There was a spade at the
foot of the wall, the presence of which at
that time he did not stop to analyze; but
later, when thinking over the events of that
night, he determined it had been brought
there to be used on him as he used it on the
dead priest. With it he dug a deep hole
where he laid the body of his only friend.
Then he fled away into the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was quite late when he reached the
little house which he had bought when he
married, and he was tired, but he thought he
would now probably be accused of two murders,
so he must get away. He changed
quickly into his most ragged clothes and
started off towards another city. How he
fared for the next few years I shall not
attempt to relate, but under an assumed
name, and with the power of his early home-training
and education, he slowly forged to
the front. He heard the stories of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>haunted sentry box and was pleased that his
disappearance had been so explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although to all outward appearance he
was poor, his new life brought him money
and in the solitude of his little home he lived
in comfort. He likewise deceived the world
as to his feelings; to his friends he seemed a
jovial, care-free fellow, but at home he sank
back into bitterness and thoughts of his
wrongs. His thoughts often turned to
Torcas, but he just as frequently turned them
aside through a desire to follow the last
words of his murdered friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not until years later when the
world had nearly banished all thought of the
sentry box episode that Delvarez, now an old
man, again saw his bitter enemy. Torcas,
to his delight, did not recognize him and
Delvarez immediately started to plan the
death of his tormentor. He waited and
waited, but the right time never seemed to
come and finally the last words of the long-dead
friend again began to take effect.
Delvarez became calmer; he looked at the
unrecognizing man with pure disdain and a
great confidence arose in him that his friend's
words would come true, that God&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story was interrupted by the stranger
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>behind the old story-teller. With a gurgling
cry of wrath he had sprung to his feet, his
right hand, tightly clenched about the handle
of a gleaming knife, shot upward, while his
left hand tore the shirt from the storekeeper's
shoulders, thus uncovering the old man's
chest, which had a dark red scar across it.
The knife started downward with terrific
force toward Cordo's bared body, but not
into it, for he, with a quick, instinctive, upward
throw of his arm, so changed the course
of the blade that it buried itself to the hilt
in its owner's breast.</p>

<p>The priest had spoken the truth: God had
taken vengeance.</p>
